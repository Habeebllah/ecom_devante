                A Terms and Conditions agreement acts as a legal contract
                between you (the company) and the user. It's where you maintain
                your rights to exclude users from your app in the event that
                they abuse your website/app, set out the rules for using your
                service and note other important details and disclaimers. Having
                a Terms and Conditions agreement is completely optional. No laws
                require you to have one. Not even the super-strict and
                wide-reaching General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your
                Terms and Conditions agreement will be uniquely yours. While
                some clauses are standard and commonly seen in pretty much every
                Terms and Conditions agreement, it's up to you to set the rules
                and guidelines that the user must agree to.
